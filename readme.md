# 2-racemap-forwarder

Our forwarder service connects MyLaps and ChronoTrack timing systems with the RACEMAP backend to forward the reads/ detections from the timing system to racemap.com.
The service also manages the communication with the MyLaps|ChronoTrack software.

- opens a port, by default the port for MyLaps connections is **3097**
- opens a second port, by default the port for ChronoTrack connections is **3000**
- listens on localhost IP: **127.0.0.1**
- RACEMAP API token is needed to forward data to racemap.com
- API token is set by using the environment var **RACEMAP_API_TOKEN**

## How to use

1. Generate the API token for your RACEMAP account. It can be found in your user section.
2. Download the service to the computer on which the MyLaps timing software is running.
3. Run the service with the API token as an environment variable or add it using the user interface.
4. Configure your timing system to send data to the service.
5. The service will forward your data to racemap.com.
